#default docker test run

docker pull hello world - docker UI image will created 

# look images list in CMD

docker images 

# To run the created image

docker run hello-world -- container will created 

##In docker UI run the created image -- it run and the result will be viewed in UI-log

#To check the container status 

docker ps

# to check the exited run container's

docker ps -a


To create simple container:
--To create the docker image and run to create a container 
--Create a foler and in VSC create docker file with name : Dockerfile
--Create lite wait lunix 

#use a base image - Dockerhub.com
FROM apline:latest
#Run a command
CMD["echo","Welcome to friday"]

Open VSC Terminal

#To create a image
docker build -t myimage.   --(User need to provide the image name )

--In docker UI the image is created as per the user defined image name

# Run the image 

docker run myimage   -- out put can see in the VSC-Terminal and  this will create a container  

#Node : to use node.js in docker file 
-need to pull the node js image from docker hub

#To  pull the node image 

docker pull node

Output: node image pulled from dockerhub 
--check the docker ui  node image is created 
---To check in CMD 

docker images 

Output:
---it list all the images  

# To run the image -node

docker run node   -- container will created 

# To start the container 

docker start (container name/id ) --- 

Output: it exit beacuse no program is run or used in the container 
To use the node in the container - we need to connect the container to the command then execution remains untill you stop the container 

docker run -it node ---(-it) will connect 

                         -i : interactive 
			 -t : TTY

Output : Termial will open 
         let  a= 1;
	 let b=2;
	console.log(a+b)
	output: 3
 ----open CMD check docker : docker ps ---runing image will display

#To Stop

docker stop (container name /id)
 ----In UI that container state :exited

# To Start the container

docker start (container name/id)

----container will start but it wont open termianal 
---- to use the command in side the container 

docker exec -it (Container name/id) node(image name ) -----To open the terminal the container 


# To open bash  in the container 

docker start (conatiner name /id) 

docker exec -it (contianer name/id) /bin/bash 

out put: 

# ls
#cd/usr/local/bin# 
#ls

       Output: node willbe there

#To Tage Container Name

docker run --name node_new_name  node  ---- a container will created in the name what user give : node_new_name

docker rename node_new_name node_rename 

#To delete container 

docker container prune  -- it will delete all the container which is not running 

output : need to give yes/no

#To copy file to container 

docker pull alpine

docker run -it --name my_apline_container alpine

output:
#ls

open new command 

Go to the folder path 

  : dir -- will show file 

# to copy file to the docker 

docker cp .\testfld.txt my_alpine_container:/example.txt -- it copy in the lunix 

docker cp .\testfld.txt my_alpine_container:/example.txt -- its copy to the folder inside the lunix

Output:
#ls
# cd/var
# cat example.txt

#To copy file form the container 

docker cp my_alpine_container:/example.txt ./example1.txt
